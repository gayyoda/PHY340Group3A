              <p>When considering potential partnerships for a crewed mission to Mars, the UK could also look to other national space agencies. Historically the UK has been a part of multiple international space missions, collaborating with a variety of agencies. Many of Britain’s first satellites were launched by NASA, the British probe Beagle 2 travelled to Mars as part of the European Space Agency’s Mars Express mission and the first Briton in space was launched as part of the USSR’s Soyuz missions, with her trip being partially funded by private British companies <a href="ref.html#ref54" class="ref-lnk">[54]</a>.</p>
              <p>The UKSA’s current closest partner is the European Space Agency and although this is subject to change given the UK’s impending exit from the European Union, the two agencies are likely to continue working together. The ESA has multiple facilities within the UK, including the European Centre for Space Applications and Telecommunications however their research is mostly focused on satellite based services rather than human space flight <a href="ref.html#ref55" class="ref-lnk">[55]</a>. One barrier in the way of a joint UKSA/ESA Mars mission is the ESA’s current lack of commitment to crewed spaceflight to Mars. Because of this, the ESA is unlikely to offer support to a British Mars mission without significant commitment and planning from the UK Space Agency.</p>
              <p>A combined UKSA/ESA Mars mission would also be likely to involve contributions from the private aerospace companies that have a close relationship with the ESA. The private company Arianespace has received funding from the ESA to develop their Ariane family of rockets and is jointly owned by organisations in various European countries, including Airbus Defence and Space <a href="ref.html#ref56" class="ref-lnk">[56]</a>. Collaboration with the ESA would provide easy access to these private connections that are likely to be vital to a successful Mars mission.</p>
