                <p>The decision of how to fund a Mars mission is almost as important as overcoming the technological challenges of interplanetary flight. The most obvious path is to allocate the majority of the funds to the UK Space Agency, however the UKSA is not currently equipped to handle such a monumental task and so would need a significant amount of time to build infrastructure. The UK could also aim to replicate NASA’s success in contracting private space transit companies to help develop the technology required for a crewed Mars mission. The UK could also collaborate with the European Space Agency, however the ESA does not currently have any plans for a crewed Mars mission and the UK’s relationship with the ESA could alter significantly post-Brexit. The UK could also work closely with NASA, who already plan to send humans to Mars, however their current Mars mission plan does not account for such a significant level of international cooperation. Similarly, while SpaceX may be planning travel to Mars, their timelines have been consistently inaccurate and the company already has a close working relationship with NASA and thus may not be open to further collaboration</p>
