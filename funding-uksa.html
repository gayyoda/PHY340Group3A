            <h2 class="report-title">UKSA Funding</h2>
            <div class="report-para">
              <p>An investment in the UK Space Agency of £100 billion with the aim of landing a crewed mission on Mars by 2040 would result in a new annual budget of at least £4 billion per year over the next 20 years of development and further years of continued mission support. This would be ten times larger than the UKSA’s current annual budget of around £370 million <a href="ref.html#ref42" class="ref-lnk">[42]</a>. Much of this funding would need to be spent recruiting for the many jobs required to support an interplanetary mission, as well as building the infrastructure to support these jobs.</p>
              <p>One major obstacle for a UK space program is the lack of current viable launch sites. Construction of a new spaceport in Sutherland, Scotland is due to begin in late 2021 <a href="ref.html#ref43" class="ref-lnk">[43]</a>, however the site is being designed primarily to support light launch vehicles, not the superheavy kind required for human transit to Mars. The UK government has also pledged £7 million to establish a private spaceport at Newquay airport, as a base for the private spaceflight company Virgin Orbit, <a href="ref.html#ref44" class="ref-lnk">[44]</a> however the site will be primarily used to launch satellite carrying rockets into orbit aboard a converted jumbo jet, a method unfeasible for launching the payloads required for interplanetary spaceflight.</p>
              <p>A UK funded Mars mission would not necessarily need to be launched from within the UK. UK built rockets have been launched from Australia, British satellites have been launched aboard NASA rockets and the European Space Agency’s Mars Express mission, which included a British probe, was launched from Kazakhstan <a href="ref.html#ref45" class="ref-lnk">[45]</a>. However, all of these previous missions have been unmanned, and having a significant geographical distance between the manufacturing facilities and launch site of a crewed mission would lead to undeniable issues. If the UK chooses to independently fund a Mars mission, a new launch site would likely have to be constructed, either at the current centre of the UK space sector in Harwell, at an RAF base, or at a new spaceflight facility built from the ground up.</p>
