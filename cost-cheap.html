              <p>NASA’s current Martian missions involve multiple trips to different points on the surface so that a colony can be established. This makes use of the long-stay trajectory which maximises the efficiency of the mission and consequently NASA’s return on investment.</p>
              <p>For the purpose of this proposal, it would not make sense to have multiple trips to Mars and establish a large colony, as this should be an international effort. Instead, a single trip will allow us to put UK boots on Martian soil, while greatly reducing the amount of equipment, planning and costs. As such, a Mars semi-direct mission, utilising a long stay trajectory is the best approach.</p>
              <h3>Sharing Costs</h3>
              <p>Funding the entirety of a mission like this would not be cost effective and collaborations can greatly reduce the cost. 
                Referring back to Section 5.3.1, some of the more universal equipment that needs to be sent to the Mars is:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Power station</li>
                  <li>Mars Surface Habitat (SHAB)</li>
                  <li>Mars Communication and Observation Satellite (MCOS)</li>
                  <li>Heliocentric Laser Communications Relay Satellite (HLCRS)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All of this equipment can be utilized by other space agencies or companies, so it makes sense to share the development costs. Since NASA’s potential mission plan is very similar, the power plant required to fuel the MAV for the UK mission could also be used for a later NASA mission. This is also true for the Mars Surface Habitat (SHAB). The UK crew could lay the foundations for the base in return for joint development of the infrastructure.</p>
                <p>However, these collaborations should not be confused as joint Space programs. Being completely tied to another nation restricts the possibility of having a UK crew member reach Mars, especially when working with NASA. Instead, these manufacturing collaborations should work to be mutually beneficial, but with no joint-mission obligations. </p>
                <p>Moreover, utilising the private sector would be critical in reducing costs. Developing, building and using UK rockets to fuel the Mars transit vehicle or sending equipment to Mars is inefficient. Given the rising number of companies which have the infrastructure to do this, it makes more sense to outsource the rockets.</p>
                <p>As such, a UK funded Mars mission is certainly possible for £100 billion, given the correct partnerships are established. Carefully planned mission architectures and manufacturing collaborations could reduce this figure significantly. However, reaching Mars by 2040 would be a challenge. To achieve this then instant action needs to be taken by the government, heavily utilising the private sector and manufacturing collaborations.</p>
