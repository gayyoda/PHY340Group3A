            <h2 class="report-title">Cycler Orbit Solution</h2>
            <div class="report-para">
              <p>The use of cycler orbits can both keep per-mission costs down and, by reducing the required fuel mass, can allow for more space and protection for the crew. Using multiple cycler vehicles, with possible intermediate stages in Earth and Mars orbit, can greatly increase the number of opportunities for transportation of crew and equipment between the planets.</p>
              <h3>Mars Cyclers</h3>
              <p>In order to ensure frequent Earth-Mars transfer opportunities, multiple cycler vehicles can be launched to different points in the same orbit. In order to ensure at least one short Earth-Mars trip and at least one short Mars-Earth trip every synodic period, we can set an upper bound of 2n on the number of vehicles required, <a href="ref.html#ref27" class="ref-lnk">[27]</a> as the cycler trajectories will cross the orbits of Earth and Mars at two points.</p>
              <p>Another option would be to have a station similar to the ISS in Mars orbit. This would make the task of resupply easier as the resupply vehicle would only have to be capable of slowing to Mars orbital speed instead of having to be capable of landing on the Martian surface. This also means that high-efficiency low-thrust engines could be used as the interplanetary section would not need to enter the atmosphere <a href="ref.html#ref32" class="ref-lnk">[32]</a>.</p>
              <h4>Aldrin Cycle</h4>
              <p>The Aldrin cycler was described by Aldrin in the 1985 <a href="ref.html#ref26" class="ref-lnk">[26]</a> and later referred to as the “most practical” in an analysis of possible cycler trajectories <a href="ref.html#ref27" class="ref-lnk">[27]</a>. It repeats every synodic period but requires powered course correction at its Earth encounters to remain stable as the turning angle at Earth is greater than the maximum that could be achieved by using only an Earth gravity assist.</p>
              <h4>Ballistic Cyclers</h4>
              <p>There are cyclers which repeat every seven synodic periods, which corresponds to 15 years. Notably, an integer number of years means that the trajectory is ballistic and therefore the orbit does not need to be turned <a href="ref.html#ref27" class="ref-lnk">[27 (Table 5)]</a>. A 7 synodic period cycle would imply that 14 vehicles are required for frequent trips; however, many of these cyclers encounter Earth and Mars more often than once every 15 years so fewer than 14 vehicles are required to ensure frequent Earth-Mars transfers <a href="ref.html#ref27" class="ref-lnk">[27]</a>.</p>
              <p>The advantage of a ballistic cycler is that the vehicle can be more massive than for a powered cycler <a href="ref.html#ref32" class="ref-lnk">[32]</a>. Such vehicles are preferred for long crewed missions as they allow for more space for the crew. This can also allow for more radiation shielding to protect the crew during deep space travel.</p>
              <h4>Getting into Orbit</h4>
              <p>The significant problem with cyclers is getting into orbit from LEO in the first place. For the case of the Aldrin cycler and a vehicle of 95mt fueled mass (75mt dry mass), it takes between 4 and 6 years to establish the orbit, depending on the method used <a href="ref.html#ref32" class="ref-lnk">[32]</a> . If low-thrust engines are used, there is a large saving in propellant mass and therefore propellant costs. As noted by Rogers et al., <a href="ref.html#ref32" class="ref-lnk">[32]</a> the time savings of two years by not using low-thrust engines over wider orbital arcs does not seem to make up for the massively increased propellant costs, considering that the vehicle will be unoccupied until the orbit is established anyway.</p>
              <p>The significant conclusion is that low-thrust propulsion technologies should be preferred for uncrewed establishment of cycler obits from LEO. After the orbit is established, a crew may rendezvous with a cycler vehicle at its Earth encounter for a several-month trip to Mars and similar in the opposite direction for returning the crew to Earth.</p>
              <p>Use of Aldrin’s cycler seems the most practical for our purposes due to its short period, lower velocities at both planets, and fairly short transfer time. In the long-term, it would be better to set up multiple vehicles in ballistic cycler orbits in order to reduce propellant cost and improve living space for crew.</p>
