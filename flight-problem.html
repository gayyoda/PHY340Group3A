              <p>As we can see from past missions, getting to Mars is not impossible. The UK has successfully funded two uncrewed missions to Mars, ExoMars <a href="ref.html#ref18" class="ref-lnk">[18]</a> in 2016 and InSight <a href="ref.html#ref19" class="ref-lnk">[19]</a> in 2018, that are currently conducting their research. However, when considering a crewed mission, things become more difficult.</p>
              <h3>Payload Fraction</h3>
              <p>When looking at previous missions to space, the mass of the spacecraft has always been a significant problem. As it requires so much energy to leave Earth’s atmosphere, most of the launch mass must be fuel. A look at NASA’s past missions shows that around 90% the mass of the launch vehicle has to be fuel in a perfect scenario <a href="ref.html#ref20" class="ref-lnk">[20]</a>. This is not a problem for uncrewed missions, but for crewed missions the mass requirement greatly increases due to the needs of the crew.</p>
              <p>For example, the crew needs, among other things, sleeping quarters, a storage area for food and other supplies, and a fitness area to help avoid muscle atrophy. All of this necessitates a higher mass at launch, thus more fuel will be needed. This, in turn, increases the cost of launch and the associated risks. In addition, if a long-term mission plan is used, the resources that the crew need to build their living and research areas would also need to be added to the mass of the craft unless the launch is split into multiple separate launches, which would affect the cost and timeframe of the mission.</p>
              <h3>Communication</h3>
              <p>For a successful crewed mission, good communication between ground control and the crew is a necessity. However, when approaching Mars, the team will have to deal with a four to twenty minute delay, depending on the orientation of the planets.</p>
              <h3>Dust</h3>
              <p>In the vacuum of space, there are many very small particles of dust that are moving very quickly. These can cause serious damage to any craft that tries to travel through space. The ISS has had a few instances of dust particles damaging pieces of equipment or the hull of the ISS.</p>
              <h3>Power</h3>
              <p>As the spacecraft will have electrical appliances on board, there needs to be a way of powering those appliances. A good way to do this in space is by using the sun’s energy through solar panels and this technology is how the ISS gets most of its power. However, on a Mars mission the ship will be travelling away from the sun and therefore, solar power will not be as efficient later in the flight, and its usefulness will decrease.</p>
