              <p>While a mission to Mars is not currently a part of NASA’s budget, the agency has commissioned concepts that outline their current best plan for interplanetary travel. Through the agency’s Artemis human spaceflight program, NASA is collaborating with international partners as well as commercial spaceflight companies to develop and build the infrastructure needed for interplanetary travel <a href="ref.html/#ref1" class="ref-lnk">[1]</a>.</p>
              <p>Since 2011, NASA has been developing the Space Launch System (SLS), the superheavy launch vehicle that will be the primary launch vehicle in the agency’s deep space exploration plans <a href="ref.html/#ref2" class="ref-lnk">[2]</a>. NASA’s Artemis program also includes plans for a space station in lunar orbit known as the Lunar Gateway <a href="ref.html/ref3" class="ref-lnk">[3]</a>. This space station would act as the first stop on any interplanetary journey and would allow for spacecraft to be repaired and refueled before launching deeper into space. </p>
              <p>As far as Mars missions are concerned, NASA’s primary focus seems to be on sending a vessel into Martian orbit, from which a crew would be able to control equipment on the surface in real time. The planned spacecraft, known as the Deep Space Transport (DST), would be composed of two elements: an Orion Capsule and a propelled habitation module. The two modules would each be launched from Earth aboard an SLS launch vehicle and would be connected together at the Lunar Gateway <a href="ref.html/#ref4" class="ref-lnk">[4]</a>. The DST would be launched from the Gateway for a flyby or orbit of Mars, then return to the Gateway, ready to be reused for future missions.</p>
              <p>The Deep Space Transport is not yet an officially proposed project, however NASA has commissioned several design concepts. One such concept is Mars Base Camp (MBC), designed by US aerospace company Lockheed Martin and is currently under study. The original proposal for the MBC was only designed to carry humans to Mars’ orbit, however in 2017 the design was updated to include a concept for a reusable crewed shuttle, which would allow humans to reach the planet’s surface before returning to the MBC <a href="ref.html/#ref5" class="ref-lnk">[5]</a>. This method of landing a crew onto the Martian surface closely mirrors the technique used in the Apollo 11 mission to land the first humans on the Moon and may be a tempting proposal for NASA’s engineers as they plan their first Mars missions.</p>
