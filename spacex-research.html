                <p>With the help of NASA investment, the private aerospace manufacturer SpaceX has gained a dominant share of the commercial space launch market. [6] This has provided the company with a comfortable position from which to plan their own crewed missions to Mars. The company was initially founded with the goal of getting humans to Mars and is currently developing its Starship launch system, which will form a key part of the company’s Mars program.</p>
                <p>While NASA’s plans for the red planet are fairly cautious, the expectations of SpaceX and it’s braggadocious CEO Elon Musk are set much higher. Musk has publicly shared the details of SpaceX’s Mars Program [7], however the private company is beholden to looser standards of scrutiny when compared to government agencies such as NASA, and as such these plans may be subject to change. This is especially true when it comes to the predicted timelines given by SpaceX, which have often been overly enthusiastic and as such have had to be pushed back multiple times [8].</p>
                <p>Musk’s long term mission is to colonise the Martian surface, and as such SpaceX’s intentions for the panet are centred around building infrastructure that will facilitate missions directly to and from the planet. According to Musk, SpaceX’s first missions to Mars would be uncrewed and would remotely construct a fuel plant that would use in situ resource collection to synthesise fuel that could then be fed into SpaceX’s reusable Starship spacecraft for return trips to Earth [9]. Once this infrastructure is in place, the corporation would then send crewed missions to perform maintenance on the existing Martian base, as well as begin constructing the first rudimentary elements required for colonisation.</p>
                <p>The most well documented element of SpaceX’s Mars program is their Starship launch vehicle which, if successful, will be used to land both crewed and uncrewed missions on the Martian surface [10]. SpaceX have proposed a similar two step launch procedure to NASA, with the Starship being first launched into Earth’s orbit where it would be refueled before launching towards Mars [11].</p>
                <p>SpaceX’s plans for both orbital refueling as well as remote construction of a Martian fuel plant remain under development and as such there is no current consensus on their viability. SpaceX is however, not the only organisation testing the feasibility of in situ resource collection, as NASA has plans to test similar techniques on the moon [12].</p>
                <p>Due to their success in reducing the cost of human space flight and their confident goals, SpaceX may seem like the most likely candidate to land the first humans on Mars. However it’s yet to be seen whether SpaceX’s Mars program will be able to live up to the bold claims of its CEO. Despite their many successes SpaceX has consistently missed many of its own proposed timelines and the company is as yet unproven outside of it’s close collaborations with NASA.</p>
