              <p>Currently, NASA and SpaceX are the only major organisations that are actively planning crewed missions to Mars. NASA’s priority appears to be developing its Space Launch System (SLS) and getting a crew into orbit with landing as a later goal. In contrast to this cautious approach, SpaceX is set on colonising the Martian surface, building the infrastructure in-situ to facilitate further missions to and from the planet.</p>
              <p>Both of these approaches share similar challenges. Particularly, long-term spaceflight has significant effects on the crew due to the isolation, closed environment, radiation, and microgravity. To minimise this risk, we recommend careful selection of crew members, noting that there are some serious changes that may enforce an upper limit on mission length. In addition, communications systems must account for delays over 20 minutes depending on the relative positions of Earth and Mars. Ensuring that a crew can confidently act independently of ground control teams is vital to the safety and success of any missions.</p>
              <p>There is also the issue of how to keep missions supplied. The solution to this has effects on the chosen mission profile; the fastest routes call for high energy expenditure and can severely limit the time spent on the surface while the more efficient routes can increase mission complexity, travel time, and their associated risks. For example, use of specific “cycler” orbits that repeatedly encounter Earth and Mars can allow for regular transfer of crew or cargo between the two planets, but it can take up to 5 years to get the uncrewed spacecraft into such orbits.</p>
              <p>We investigate several mission profiles and determine that a semi-direct mission, using Aldrin’s cycler, allows for efficient initial uncrewed setup and repeated supply, with approximately 550 days on the surface of Mars. A long-stay mission serves to counter the effects of interplanetary travel on the crew and increases the return on investment of the program in general. This proposal has significant setup time, however, and as the ideal time to launch the crew to Mars is 2033-2035, there is little over a decade to complete the full R&D cycle for all mission-related infrastructure.</p>
              <p>There are four main funding options which we discuss in this report: directly funding the UK Space Agency (UKSA); contracting work to private companies; starting major collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA); and starting collaboration with NASA. We determine that the most promising way forward is to work with both UK-based companies and ESA. Such collaborations allow for sharing the cost of research, development, and manufacturing of required equipment and make a UK Mars mission possible on a budget of £100 billion.</p>
              <p>Overall, we conclude that the UKSA alone is not equipped to execute a Mars mission in a 20 year time frame and would likely go over-budget. However, effective collaborations could reduce the overall cost to less than £100 billion. A 2040 deadline is very ambitious and its feasibility is uncertain. We predict that this deadline is unlikely to be met.</p>
