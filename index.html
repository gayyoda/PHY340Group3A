            <div id="summary-txt">
              <p>While multiple countries have launched unmanned missions to the red planet, there are currently only two active organisations whose plans include crewed missions to Mars: NASA and SpaceX. NASA’s current focus seems to be on launching humans into Martian orbit, with landing a crew on the surface of Mars seeming to be a secondary goal. On the contrary, if SpaceX’s CEO Elon Musk is to be believed, the company’s sights are set firmly on colonising the Martian surface. These two primary goals have resulted in subtly different mission plans that have distinct technical challenges to overcome.</p>              
              <p>A multitude of health complications can occur when travelling in space, and it is important to consider these when planning a space mission. NASA’s human research program identified five main risks that are associated with space travel: gravity fields, isolation, closed environments, space radiation, and distance from Earth. In addition, spaceflight causes changes to the human body. While these are mostly reversible, such as movement of fluid and motion sickness, more serious changes like bone loss could enforce an upper limit on the period that a human could be in space. The risks, solutions, and changes to the human body all contribute to who should be selected to crew an interplanetary mission.</p>
              <p>The safest and most efficient way to send humans to Mars is on a high energy, long stay mission which utilises the conjunction-class trajectory. This minimises the time spent in transit while maximising time on the surface. Cargo would be sent on the same trajectory but with a lower energy expenditure. This adds time to the journey but allows for increased capacity. Alternatively, the opposition-class trajectory enables the fastest route to Mars and back. However, the transit time is high with minimal time spent on the surface, increasing the risk to the astronauts. This mission also requires a gravity assist and high energy expenditure, adding to the complexity of the mission and risk to the crew.</p>
              <p>The use of specific orbits that cycle between encounters with Earth and Mars can both keep per-mission costs down and, by reducing the required fuel mass, can allow for more space and protection for the crew. Using multiple cycler vehicles, with possible intermediate stages in Earth and Mars orbit, can greatly increase the number of opportunities for transportation of crew and equipment between the planets.</p>
              <p>The decision of how to fund a Mars mission is almost as important as overcoming the technological challenges of interplanetary flight. The most obvious path is to allocate the majority of the funds to the UK Space Agency, however the UKSA is not currently equipped to handle such a monumental task. A promising option would be to contract private aerospace companies to address the technical challenges. Collaboration with the European Space Agency is also an option; however, the ESA does not currently have any plans for a crewed Mars mission and the UK’s relationship with the ESA could alter significantly post-Brexit. A joint UK-US program could be a possibility, but their current Mars plans do not account for such a significant level of international cooperation.</p>
