            <div class="report-para">
              <p>When assessing the feasibility of a Mars mission, one must consider the length of time
                it takes to reach Mars and the time spent on the Martian surface. Assuming current
                propulsion technologies, it is the spacecraft's trajectory which has significant impact
                over these factors. Different trajectories results in short stay mission and long
                stay missions.</p>
              <p>The safest and most efficient way to send humans to Mars is on a high energy, long
                stay mission which utilises the conjunction class trajectory. This minimises the time
                spent in transit while maximising time on the surface. Cargo would be sent on the
                same trajectory but with a lower energy expenditure. This adds time to the journey but
                allows for increased capacity.
                </p>
              <p>Alternatively, the operation class trajectory enables the fastest route to Mars and back. However, the transit time is high with minimal time spent on the surface, increasing
                the risk to the astronauts. This mission also requires a gravity assist and high energy
                expenditure, adding to the complexity of the mission and risk to the crew.
                </p>
              <h3>Short Stay Mission: Opposition Class</h3>
              <p>The short stay mission requires the rocket to be launched when Mars is at its closest point to Earth and takes advantage of a Venus gravity assist (either outbound or on return). It requires  large energy expenditure, with long return travel times and limited time on the surface. Generally speaking, the total mission would take 650 days with 30-90 days on Mars <a href="ref.html#ref33" class="ref-lnk">[33]</a>.</p>
              <p>The benefits of this is that the total mission time is relatively short and is the fastest way to get humans to and from Mars. The short stay time also limits the amount of cargo that needs to be sent to Mars before-hand. 30 days is not much time for the astronauts to complete any significant work (in regards to constructing a colony), so the cargo would only include the essentials for survival and research. This cuts down on cost and logistics <a href="ref.html#ref34" class="ref-lnk">[34]</a>.</p>
              <p>While the crew can launch when Earth and Mars are closest, the nature of a short stay mission does not allow for favourable orbits to align for the return journey, as you do not have the time to wait on the Martian surface. As such, a Venus gravity assist is required to correct the trajectory of the spacecraft so that it reaches its target <a href="ref.html#ref33" class="ref-lnk">[33]</a>. The gravity assist can be used on either the outbound or inbound flight, though since it adds an extra year to the journey it would most likely be on the way back. Utilising this gravity assist allows for a lower propulsion energy expenditure. However, this complicates the trajectory and adds additional risk to the mission, especially exposure to radiation <a href="ref.html#ref33" class="ref-lnk">[33]</a><a href="ref.html#ref35" class="ref-lnk">[35]</a>.</p>
              <p>There are significant limitations to the short stay mission. Firstly, the limited contact time greatly reduces the work that the astronauts can complete, making it an inefficient trip in terms of productivity and development of a Martian base. Additionally, the return journey is incredibly long. However, if your key criteria is just ‘getting UK boots on Mars by 2040’, then this is not a big problem. </p>
              <p>What is much more important is the time spent in transit. The nature of this trajectory is such that 95% of the mission is spent traveling in a 0g environment <a href="ref.html#ref34" class="ref-lnk">[34]</a>. The health effects that this would have are significant and the recovery time on the Martian surface is very short <a href="ref.html#ref36" class="ref-lnk">[36]</a>. Additionally, the Venus swing-by adds an extra 360 days to the mission, so if the swing-by is used outbound then the astronauts ability to safely execute the landing is called into question due to the long travel time. The swing-by also exposes the crew to large amounts of radiation <a href="ref.html#ref34" class="ref-lnk">[34]</a>. Clearly, the Short Stay mission is not the safest way to reach Mars with humans on board.</p>
              <h3>Long Stay Mission: Conjunction Class</h3>
              <p>The long stay mission maximises time spent on Mars while reducing the time spent in transit. The additional time spent on the surface allows for favourable return orbits. Utilising propulsion energy during the flight (high energy), the total mission length is approximately 910 days, with 550 days spent on the surface and 360 days in transit (180 days outbound, 180 days inbound) <a href="ref.html#ref33" class="ref=lnk">[33]</a>. </p>
              <p>A huge advantage of this trajectory is that both inbound and outbound flights are relatively short, each around 180 days (6 months) if the propulsive energy is maximised. This minimises time spent in zero gravity, significantly reducing the risk posed to the astronauts <a href="ref.html#34" class="ref-lnk">[34]</a>. Comparatively, the short stay journey mission is 310 days each way (on average). Moreover, the long surface stay time enables lots of work to be completed as well as a chance for the astronauts to recover from the journey and acclimatise to Mars. However, this requires large amounts of cargo to be shipped to Mars that can facilitate a long stay. This will greatly increase the logistical factor of putting humans on Mars and will likely have a later launch date compared to a short stay mission. However, this is undoubtedly the best method for transporting humans to Mars as the health risks are greatly reduced.</p>
              <p>Additionally, a lower energy expenditure rocket would be useful for transporting cargo. Lower propulsive energy expenditure adds time to the journey but enables more cargo (as less propellant required). Since this is unmanned the increased transit time is not an issue and is the easiest way to transport goods <a href="ref.html#ref34" class="ref-lnk">[34]</a>. As such, we NASA’s mission design reference architecture recommends a conjunction class trajectory <a href="ref.html#ref36" class="ref-lnk">[36]</a> <a href="ref.html#ref37" class="ref-lnk">[37]</a>.  </p>
              <h3>Time Frames</h3>
              <p>Due to the elliptical nature of Mars’s orbit, the point at which it is closest to the sun also means that it is closest to Earth. This distance reaches a minimum point every 15.8 years, with the next minimum occurring between 2033-2035.</p>
              <p>This would be an optimum time to launch a long stay mission as it would reduce the outbound transit time. Additionally, it gives a 13 year buffer to send the cargo safely to Mars before the astronauts launch <a href="ref.html#ref33" class="ref-lnk">[33]</a> <a href="ref.html#ref37" class="ref-lnk">[37]</a>. Whether or not 13 years is enough time for the UK to establish everything which is needed underpins our ability to reach Mars by 2040. While it is not essential to launch at this time, it certainly makes the most sense if we want to reach Mars by 2040. </p>
              <h3>Propulsion Energy</h3>
              <p>A key aspect in the decision making is assessing the delta-V value for the mission. This describes the propulsive energy. The short stay missions have a large delta-V variation compared to the long stay missions. This is because the orbits are not optimal on the return mission and so carefully timed propulsions and manoeuvres are required. This requires more fuel, adds extra time/complexity to the mission and adds additional risk. The long-stay missions have lower delta-V requirements, meaning less fuel is needed <a href="ref.html#ref38" class="ref-lnk">[38]</a>.</p>
              <p>However, the long stay mission still requires propulsions (and hence delta-V variability) in order to minimise the time astronauts spend in transit. The cargo can be sent on the minimum energy trajectory as the increased travel times are not an issue. </p>
