            <div class="report-para">
              <p>All analysis so far has been focused on the UK developing its own Mars mission from the ground up, however if the priority is simply to land British boots onto the Martian surface, the government could consider becoming a contributor to one of the Mars missions already in development. The UKSA is already one of the international partners to NASA’s Artemis program, <a href="ref.html#ref57" class="ref-lnk">[57]</a> which includes plans to send humans to Mars. As a crewed mission to Mars is yet to be part of an official NASA budget, none of these international partners have formally pledged to contribute resources to such a mission. However, agencies such as the ESA have already pledged to collaborate on key elements of infrastructure, such as the planned Lunar Gateway space station.</p>
              <p>For example, the ESA has agreed to provide service modules for Artemis, which would be manufactured by Airbus <a href="ref.html#ref58" class="ref-lnk">[58]</a>. If the UKSA uses the proposed additional funding to initiate partnerships with private companies and build infrastructure, the UK could offer a similar contribution to a NASA Mars mission. However, even if the UK is able to secure such a collaboration, there would be no guarantee that NASA would include a British astronaut in the mission’s crew. </p>
              <p>Two groups of astronauts have already been assigned to the Artemis program, with the only non-American members being two Canadian Space Agency astronauts <a href="ref.html#ref59" class="ref-lnk">[59]</a>. The UKSA could negotiate to have a British astronaut selected as part of a Mars mission crew. However, having a British astronaut successfully complete training would require a significant investment of both time and money and the UK would have to offer a significantly larger contribution to the program than any currently being offered by any other international partner. Such a collaboration is likely to be costly, inefficient and would require a huge amount of prior commitment with no guarantee of success.</p>
              <p>The final potential partner would be the only private company actively developing their own Mars program: SpaceX. As a private entity, SpaceX is more likely to be influenced by UK investment, especially when choosing a crew to travel to Mars, however this option is not without its negatives. Firstly, given that SpaceX is based entirely within the US, and has already received tax-free funding from the US government, the company is likely to prioritise collaboration with NASA over a potential partnership with the UKSA <a href="ref.html#ref60" class="ref-lnk">[60]</a>. Despite this, the UK would be offering a different type of proposal, where they would be contributing to SpaceX’s own Mars mission, as opposed to the current relationship with NASA, where the company develops hardware for NASA’s own missions.</p>
              <p>This may be an enticing proposal for SpaceX, who would have majority control over the program, however such a relationship may be risky for the UK. SpaceX’s predictions regarding their Mars program have often been inaccurate, especially when giving timelines for when they will hit major mission milestones <a href="ref.html#ref8" class="ref-lnk">[8]</a>. As a private company, SpaceX is not beholden to the rigour that is required of government agencies and so the company’s claims about their Mars mission cannot be taken at face value.</p>
