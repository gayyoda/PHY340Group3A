              <p>Given the huge amount of infrastructure required for interplanetary space flight, we would advise that a UK Mars mission includes collaboration between the UK Space Agency and one or more private companies or international space agencies. Working closely with private companies has been vital in lowering the costs of human spaceflight for both the ESA and NASA, and given the time and budget constraints, contracting private spaceflight companies is a must for the proposed mission. Out of the companies active within the space sector and with a presence within the UK, Airbus Defence and Space as well as Reaction Engines Limited are the two best candidates and we would recommend working with one or both of these companies.</p>
              <p>As for international space agencies, we would recommend collaborating with the European Space Agency, however we would recommend that they are brought on as partners with the UKSA leading the program.</p>
              <p>Once development of the UK’s Mars mission is underway, the UKSA would be able to offer to utilise newly built manufacturing and research facilities to contribute to NASA’s Artemis program. In exchange for this increased contribution, the UK could negotiate for sharing of research, usage of NASA facilities or selection of British astronauts for NASA missions. While the UK should not rely on receiving any of these as part of negotiations, these collaborations are very important to execute the mission by 2040. </p>
              <p>Once a UK Mars mission begins development and the UKSA’s presence in the international space sector increases, other companies and national space agencies may offer to contribute. This could take the form of landing the mission at a SpaceX Mars base or Russia’s Roscosmos building modules in exchange for samples from the Martian surface, or establishing equipment on Mars. These potential collaborations would not become apparent until the UK has committed to sending astronauts to Mars and should be considered on a case by case basis once the program is underway.</p>
