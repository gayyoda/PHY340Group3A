                <h3>NASA's Human Research Program</h3>
                <p>The NASA Human Research Program is a biomedical program focused on developing technologies and methods to help overcome the effects of space travel on human health and performance <a href="ref.html#ref13" class="ref-lnk">[13]</a>. Their experiments are conducted on Earth and aboard the International Space Station (ISS), with the aim of answering questions such as whether the risk to astronauts is the same at three years in space as they are at three months. </p>
                <p>One of the experiments conducted by the NASA Human Research Program is the NASA Twins study <a href="ref.html#ref14" class="ref-lnk">[14]</a>. This experiment involved identical twin astronauts Mark Kelly and Scott Kelly, with Scott Kelly spending nearly a year on the ISS whereas Mark Kelly remained on Earth.  Due to the astronauts identical genetic makeup and similar physique, NASA was able  to see how long-term spaceflight affects human health. </p>
                <p>The research conducted by the Human Research Program identified the main risks that would be experienced during long duration space flight, as well as solutions that could be used to reduce the consequences of these risks. These were split into five main categories: gravity fields, isolation/confinement, hostile/closed environments, space radiation and the distance from Earth <a href="ref.html#ref15" class="ref-lnk">[15]</a>. </p>
                <h4>Gravity Fields</h4>
                <p>During a Mars Mission, there are 3 main gravitational fields that will be experienced: weightlessness/zero gravity, Mars's gravity field which is 1/3 of the Earth’s gravity, and then Earth’s gravity <a href="ref.html#ref13" class="ref-lnk">[13]</a>. The experience of travelling from one gravitational field to another is challenging on the human body and has potential to cause several health issues, such as motion sickness. The change in gravitational strength can also affect bone density, leading to osteoporosis, and fluid buildup in the body, leading to vision problems and the production of kidney stones. It may also lead to medicine reacting differently. Research into how the body reacts to gravitational changes is needed in order to see what protections can be provided. Examples of these protections could include bisphosphonate drugs to help prevent bone loss, <a href="ref.html#ref15" class="ref-lnk">[15]</a> <a href="ref.html#ref16" class="ref-lnk">[16]</a> which is one of the major problems with space travel, as well as regular exercise of approximately 2.5 hours per day and six days per week, <a href="ref.html#ref16" class="ref-lnk">[16]</a> as well as proper nutrition to maintain bone, heart, and muscle health. </p>
                <h4>Isolation and Confinement</h4>
                <p>In a confined space, behavioural issues are extremely likely to occur, especially over a long period. A mission to Mars would be the longest a space crew would have been confined to one space and therefore the crew is likely to feel the consequences of being in this space for a large period of time. NASA stated that “the more confined and isolated humans are, the more likely they are to develop behavioural or cognitive conditions and psychiatric disorders.” <a href="ref.html#ref15" class="ref-lnk">[15]</a>. The newest technologies helping crews with the effects of confinement include LEDs to mimic the light on Earth, which can help improve sleep. Other solutions involve actigraphy and writing journals.</p>
                <h4>Hostile and Closed Enviroments</h4>
                <p>When planning a space mission, whether a low orbit mission or a deep space mission, the living and working quarters within the spacecraft need to be carefully planned for maximum efficiency as well as to limit the spread of illnesses throughout the crew <a href="ref.html#ref15" class="ref-lnk">[15]</a>. Within a confined space, microorganisms can easily spread between the crew, leading to illnesses. To help limit the spread of diseases, air quality should be monitored and samples from the astronauts should be analysed to check for diseases.</p>
                <h4>Space Radiation</h4>
                <p>The most dangerous part of any space mission is the level of radiation that may be encountered <a href="ref.html#ref13" class="ref-lnk">[13]</a>. On the ISS, astronauts receive a level of radiation that is over ten times the level of Earth, but this is with the shielding of both the Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field <a href="ref.html#ref15" class="ref-lnk">[15]</a>. For example, a six month stay on the ISS exposes an astronaut to approximately 80 millisievert (mSv) of radiation <a href="ref.html#ref16" class="ref-lnk">[16]</a>. However, the level of radiation experienced on Mars would be much higher, potentially greater than 900mSv given current technologies <a href="ref.html#ref16" class="ref-lnk">[16]</a>. An increased level of radiation causes several health issues, including an increased risk of cancer, as well as the potential for radiation sickness. The increased radiation could also have an effect on the food, medicine, vehicles and living facilities meaning that significant shielding against the radiation would be needed.</p>
                <h4>Distance from Earth</h4>
                <p>Due to the distance away from the Earth, self-sufficiency is an important quality needed for a Mars mission. A crew would need to be able to complete the objective of the mission even with temporary communication or non-critical machinery failure. The distance is also a challenge when planning what supplies would need to be taken on the mission, for example what food and medicine should be taken to allow the crew to be self-sufficient. To aid self-sufficiency, NASA is doing research into what medical events are likely to occur in space and how these could be dealt with <a href="ref.html#ref15" class="ref-lnk">[15]</a>. Solutions to medical events are likely to include performing ultrasounds and producing IV solutions <a href="ref.html#ref15" class="ref-lnk">[15]</a>. Taking equipment for defibrillation and ECGs, as well as many types of medication is also necessary <a href="ref.html#ref16" class="ref-lnk">[16]</a>. Research is also being conducted into specifically what food and drugs are ideal interplanetary spaceflight.</p>
                <h3>Changes to the Human Body in Space</h3>
                <p>Space travel affects the body in several ways and the severity depends on the length of time travelling through space. Examples of ways the body changes are listed below:</p>
                <h4>Bone and Muscle Loss</h4>
                <p>Due to the weightlessness experienced during a space mission, bone and muscle mass is lost due to being worked less. This is especially seen in the muscles in the legs and produces an effect similar to atrophy in bedridden patients on Earth. The most serious and possibly non reversible effect of space travel is bone loss. Bone loss does not stabilise with space flight. Research has shown that approximately 4g of calcium is lost per month in space and that exercise and dietary changes have no effect on bone loss <a href="ref.html#ref17" class="ref-lnk">[17]</a>. This means that bone loss could provide a maximum timeframe that a human could be in space without doing irreversible damage <a href="ref.html#ref17" class="ref-lnk">[17]</a>.</p>
                <h4>Motion Sickness</h4>
                <p>Approximately three quarters of astronauts experience motion sickness <a href="ref.html#ref17" class="ref-lnk">[17]</a>, especially during lift off and the first week into the mission. Motion sickness causes astronauts to experience nausea and to feel disorientated. It also occurs when astronauts return to Earth, due to experiencing Earth’s gravitational strength. There are drugs that reduce the symptoms of motion sickness, but motion sickness cannot be entirely controlled.</p>
                <h4>Movement of Fluid</h4>
                <p>During the first few hours without the effects of gravity, approximately two litres of fluid moves through an astronaut’s body from the legs into the upper body, especially the head <a href="ref.html#ref17" class="ref-lnk">[17]</a>. This movement of fluid can cause vision problems, as well as kidney stones however it is reversible and the fluid will move back within the first few hours of landing back on Earth. </p>
                <h4>Weight Loss</h4>
                <p>During a space mission, an astronaut is likely to experience weight loss within the first fortnight of the mission <a href="ref.html#ref17" class="ref-lnk">[17]</a>. This is likely due to the other changes that occur to the body in space. However, when returning to Earth astronauts are likely to gain back the weight that they lost.</p>
                <h4>Anaemia</h4>
                <p>During space flight, a ten to fifteen percent decrease in red cell mass is observed <a href="ref.html#ref17" class="ref-lnk">[17]</a>. However, as the lifecycle of red blood cells is hundred and twenty days, the cells will be reproduced in a weightlessness state and no functional alterations will be made to them. </p>
                <h4>Heart Problems</h4>
                <p>Space flight causes changes in the way the heart functions in a large percentage of astronauts. This is because the heart must learn to pump against less resistance in space due to the reduced gravity <a href="ref.html#ref16" class="ref-lnk">[16]</a>. </p>
                <p>Most changes to astronauts' bodies have proved to be reversible, however bone loss could prove to be a limiting factor in how long a human could travel in space due to its irreversible nature <a href="ref.html#ref17" class="ref-lnk">[17].</a> </p>
