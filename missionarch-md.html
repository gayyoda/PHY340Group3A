              <p>Before the costs of a Mars Mission can be considered, the mission architecture must be understood. Using these estimates we can predict prices for different mission types.</p>
              <h3>NASA Mission Architecture</h3>
              <p>NASA’s current Mars Design Reference Architecture (DRA) has been in development since 1995, with a recent iteration completed in 2009 <a href="ref.html#ref39" class="ref-lnk">[39]</a>. This is one of the most well researched mission plans to date and accounts for every aspect of the mission.</p>
              <p>Additionally, NASA’s Mars Design Reference Mission (DRM) analyses different missions possibilities. The first DRM (1993) was centred on a Mars Semi-Direct mission, estimated to cost $55 billion over a 10 year period <a href="ref.html#ref40" class="ref-lnk">[40]</a>.</p>
              <p>The current DRA accounts for 3 Mars missions over a 10 year period which allows for optimal exploration of Mars. Each mission involves a crew of 6 visiting a different location than the previous mission, allowing more research to be completed. Long-stay trajectories would be utilised (Conjunction Class) where much of the equipment is sent beforehand on a low energy trajectory <a href="ref.html#ref39" class="ref-lnk">[39]</a>.</p>
              <h3>Mars Direct v Semi-Direct</h3>
              <p>Both of these mission architectures were put forward in research papers by Robert Zubrin <a href="ref.html#ref41" class="ref-lnk">[41]</a>. The Mars Direct mission was proposed in 1990, though subsequent changes were made resulting in the semi-direct mission design <a href="ref.html#ref40" class="ref-lnk">[40]</a>. This has subsequently been adapted for NASA’s DRA. Again, due to the extensive research in this field, these missions plans appear to be reliable options.</p>
              <h3>Direct</h3>
              <p>An uncrewed cargo mission is sent to Mars, including an un-fuelled Earth Return Vehicle (ERV) and power plant. The fuel for the EVR is made remotely on Mars. The most effective way to do this is still a point of contention. This propellant is stored and used to power the ERV for the return trip. All this occurs before the crew arrives so that the return vehicle is available and fully fuelled at any given time <a href="ref.html#ref41" class="ref-lnk">[41]</a>. Crucially, the ERV will launch from the Martian surface and take the crew directly back to Earth <a href="ref.html#ref41" class="ref-lnk">[41]</a>.</p>
              <h3>Semi-Direct</h3>
              <p>The key difference in this mission type is that an un-fuelled Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) is sent to the surface instead of the ERV. The MAV is also fuelled on Mars. The purpose of the MAV is to launch the crew from the Martian surface into orbit, though it does not have the capability to travel back to Earth. As such the crew will need an in-orbit rendezvous with the ERV to return home <a href="ref.html#ref41" class="ref-lnk">[41]</a>.</p>
              <p>This adds additional complexity to the mission. Firstly, the ERV is not readily available  for the crew to use and they will have to execute an in-orbit docking procedure. However, the MAV only requires 1/3 of the propellant that the EVR needs <a href="ref.html#ref41" class="ref-lnk">[41]</a>. This greatly reduces the power requirements for the production of the fuel which is very important. Additionally the ERV can be much larger since it remains in orbit, which is important for the safety of the crew. As such, we recommend the semi direct approach.</p>
