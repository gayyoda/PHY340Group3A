            <div class="report-para">
              <p>Funding a UK Mars mission entirely through public agencies is not the only way of allocating funding. NASA has been successful in cultivating private space companies such as SpaceX through their Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) program <a href="ref.html#ref46" class="ref-lnk">[46]</a>. By awarding contracts for concept studies, development projects and transit of cargo and crew to the International Space Station, NASA has been able to seed funding into a number of private space companies. This program has also made the cost of rocket development up to 10 times cheaper, saving NASA millions of dollars <a href="ref.html#ref47" class="ref-lnk">[47]</a>.</p>
              <p>The UK Space Agency already works closely with a number of private companies within the space sector and this program could be expanded to help develop the technology required for a successful Mars mission. Taking advantage of existing private infrastructure such as supply chains and manufacturing plants could help save both time and money, which would be vital given the strict suggested timeline and budget. However, to fully benefit from the advantages of private investment, the UK would have to choose partners who are already active within the UK space sector. </p>
              <p>Out of the viable companies for such investment, the largest is Airbus Defence and Space. Whilst based in Germany, the company has multiple sites within the UK, including a presence at the Harwell Space Cluster, a hub for organisations within the UK space industry <a href="ref.html#ref48" class="ref-lnk">[48]</a>. The company also has close ties to the European Space Agency, including leading development and testing of the agency’s Ariane family of launch vehicles.</p>
              <p>The British company Virgin Group has two subsidiaries within the space industry: Virgin Galactic and Virgin Orbit. Virgin Galactic is focused on carrying tourists into suborbital space, launched from beneath a carrier aeroplane, <a href="ref.html#ref49" class="ref-lnk">[49]</a> while Virgin Orbit uses a similar air launched vehicle to carry small satellites into orbit <a href="ref.html#ref50" class="ref-lnk">[50]</a>. Given the payload sizes required for interplanetary travel this launch method would be unfeasible for use in a Mars mission, and therefore neither company would be a good candidate for funding.</p>
              <p>Reaction Engines Limited is a British aerospace manufacturer which has already received funding from the UKSA and ESA to develop its SABRE engine <a href="ref.html#ref51" class="ref-lnk">[51]</a>. The company has also collaborated with UKSA and the European Space Agency to design a reusable space plane known as Skylon, which would utilise the SABRE engine <a href="ref.html#ref52" class="ref-lnk">[52]</a>. REL has even designed a concept for a crewed mission to Mars, called Reaction Engines Project Troy. Spacecraft modules would be transported aboard a Skylon vehicle to a proposed orbital space station where the modules would be combined. An initial set of unmanned missions would be sent to set up a base on the Martian surface, followed by a manned mission into Martian orbit, from which the crew could be ferried to and from the Martian surface <a href="ref.html#ref53" class="ref-lnk">[53]</a>. Project Troy is still just a concept for how interplanetary travel could be achieved, however given the company’s clear interest in travel to Mars, REL could be an excellent partner for a potential Mars mission.</p>
